        "It is a mapping between two categories. A `functor` maps not only objects, but also functions (called `morphisms`)\n",
        "\n",
        "`Functor` preserves structure between objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way to think about it is, you have a value in a Box and you can transform the value and still keep them in the Box.\n",
        "Here, because the the type of Box is not changing, only the type of the value - it is `endofunctor`\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "f x = x ( int -> int)\n",

        "## Why?\n",
        "TODO\n",
        "\n",
        "## Rules\n",
        "1. There should be an `identity` function that returns the `functor` unchanged\n",
        "2. If you have two functions `f` and `g`, then mapping over one after the other should be the same as mapping over the composition of `f` and `g\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "        functor.map(g).map(f) = functor.map(i => f(g(i)))\n",
